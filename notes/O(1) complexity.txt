Normally we use maps to maintain constant time complexity

But maps don't have order

So, if you want order AND constant time complexity
We use a combination of DOUBLY LINKED LIST and HASHMAP 

HASHMAP MAPPING: key => Corresponding Node in list

AND MOREOVER, to avoid encountering too many edge cases which lead to NULL POINTER EXCEPTION
we make head and tail as dummy nodes

HEAD => (-1, -1)
TAIL => (-1, -1)

Order will be reverse:
  MOST RECENT ELEMENT: right next to head
  LEAST RECENT ELEMENT: prev element to tail
