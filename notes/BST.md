- Balanced Binary Search trees are performance-wise good as they provide O(log n) time for search, insert and delete.
- Reason for above statement: Because in a BST, when you're searching or inserting or deleting, the system would only go over one node at a level, hence it'll always max to max traverse to logn no. of nodes as height is logn
