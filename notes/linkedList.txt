# When reversing a part of a linked list, it doesn't split the parts into separate lists, for instance:
1->2->3->
we reverse starting from 2, making:
<-2<-3
but 1 still points to 2, so we have:
1->2<-3
   |
   V
  null


# use fast and slow pointers to get mid

# use a dummy node to merge two lists

# two ways to reverse a linked list
    first: // this makes the changes in the original list

        using cur, prev and next pointers
        prev and next initial value will be null
        cur would be first node
        then we make changes in the while loop
        like,
        next = cur.next     cur.next = prev   prev = cur    cur = next

    second:  // this makes a new list

        in while loop, make a new node each time using new ListNode(cur.val)
        then do (add at first) thing to reverse the whole thing

        ListNode revHead = null; // the first node's next will be null
        ListNode curr = head;
        

        while (curr != null) {
            ListNode temp = new ListNode(curr.val);
            temp.next = revHead;
            revHead = temp; // we bring revHead pointer backward bc next time we're going to insert something before this
            curr = curr.next;
        }

        now at last, revHead will point to the head of our new list.
