trees are similar to linked list based on structure

One Node ---> two pointers ----> left and right

Why do we use trees?
- most operations can be done in O(logN) time complexity which is more efficient than linked list.
- nodes are stored in such a order that it makes operations easier to perform
- cost efficient as it doesn't need to restructure itself when a lot of data is added

in this case all the operations do become same as linked list, this is called an unbalanced binary tree.
